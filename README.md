Turning my Samsung S21 Ultra into my Desktop

1. Follow [this code](https://github.com/tuanpham-dev/termux-ubuntu)
2. 

##chrome
1. I set "request desktop site" under chrome://flags". What im thinking is that i shd set my phone screen to a low resolution then my Dex resolution to high. So that it'll default to desktop site on Dex only.
